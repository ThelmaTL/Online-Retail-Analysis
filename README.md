# Online-Retail-Analysis

---
## 1. Executive Summary

This project analyzes an online retail dataset to uncover valuable business insights into customer purchasing behavior and sales performance. Using Python and data analytics techniques, raw transactional data was cleaned, explored and transformed into meaningful information.

The goal of the project was to understand how customer interactions translate into purchases and to identify trends that influence revenue generation. Through data cleaning, exploratory data analysis and visualization, the project highlights key sales patterns, top-performing products, and customer activity trends.

The insights generated can support data-driven decision-making for improving marketing strategies, inventory management and overall business performance.

## 2. Business Problem

Online retail businesses generate massive amounts of transactional data daily. However, many organizations struggle to convert this raw data into actionable insights.

The main business problems addressed in this project include:

* Understanding customer purchasing behavior
* Identifying top-selling and underperforming products
* Detecting sales trends over time
* Analyzing revenue performance across different regions
* Exploring factors that influence conversion from product views (clicks) to purchases (carts)

Without proper analysis, businesses risk making decisions based on assumptions rather than data.

This project aims to bridge that gap by transforming raw retail data into meaningful insights that can drive smarter business strategies.

## 3. Methodology

A structured data analytics workflow was followed to ensure accurate and reliable results:

### Step 1 – Data Collection

* Imported the online retail dataset into a Python environment using Pandas

### Step 2 – Data Cleaning

* Handling missing values
* Removing duplicate records
* Fixing incorrect data types
* Filtering invalid or negative quantities
* Standardizing data formats

### Step 3 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Descriptive statistics
* Revenue and sales calculations
* Customer purchase behavior analysis
* Product performance evaluation

### Step 4 – Data Visualization

* Sales trend analysis using charts
* Top products visualization
* Country-wise revenue distribution
* Transaction pattern analysis

### Step 5 – Insight Generation

* Extracted meaningful conclusions from the analyzed data

This methodology ensured that raw data was properly transformed into actionable business intelligence.
